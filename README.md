This blog covers whatever comes up in my mind, ranging from code (I'm a simple hobbyist) to games, from life to free and open source software. (<3)

## Used tools (thanks a lot!)
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the static site generator and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- The [Pixyll Jekyll theme](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) was crafted with <3 by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) ([@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine)). ([MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
- Lots of things I must have forgotten

The rest is probably part of the [Pixyll Jekyll theme](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) listed above and is thus licensed under the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)).

If you're unsure, you can probably steal it. Or shoot me a message.
