You can find me in many places, but I'll list the most common ones below.

- E-mail: steef435 [U+0040] hotmail [U+002E] com
- Arch Linux Forums: [Steef435](https://bbs.archlinux.org/profile.php?id=74574)
- GitHub: [Steef435](https://github.com/Steef435)
- Most other places: Steef435

It's not that hard, really. I'm also an occasional League of Legends player, there you can find me as Latest Legend. ([MOBAFire profile](http://www.mobafire.com/profile/latest-legend-316909))

Are there other places to find me? Who knows. Stay sharp. If you hear a sorry joke around the corner, chances are you're warm. I'm not allergic to garlic but you can always try.
