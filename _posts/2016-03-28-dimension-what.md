title: Dimension... What?

summary: "This season's *Dimension W*: great start, disappointing end. A short and subjective anime review."
---

"New anime from the creator of Darker than Black." That is what moved me to take a look at the anime adaption of *Dimension W*. According to *very* short research, Yuji Iwahara's role in this series wasn't more than *that guy that wrote the manga*, but that shouldn't scare you off right away. Not right away. Jokes aside, below is a rather short, subjective and spoiler-free review of this now finished anime series.

**Spoilers: few, just introductory subjects.**

## Introduction
A few decades from now, the world is dominated by *New Tesla*, an energy company that supplies the whole world with energy gained from the mysterious dimension *W*. As all resources of infinite energy, however, using them wrongly can lead to *really big* cleaning jobs. Needless to say people are trying to use this energy for wrongdoing. Because all energy consumed by legal means is being monitored, illegal *coils* (imagine a small round battery) are used. Needless to say illegal coils can lead to even bigger stains. Bounty hunters called *collectors* retrieve illegal coils for a living.

I will say it now so I won't have to say it again: the science fiction is not really on the level I had hoped it would be on, something you might have gathered already with names like *New Tesla*, *coil* and dimension *W* (X, Y, W! Genius) but most of it more than passes through fantasy goggles. More on this later.

The story centers around the collector Mabuchi Kyoma. One day, he meets a staggeringly sophisticated robot, which he will be forced to work with, despite his bitter hatred for everything that has to do with coils (portrayed by his gasoline-fueled cars and appliances).

A robot, apart from her metallic heart looking just like a normal girl -- just who or what is she? -- and the mysterious -- where does his bitterness towards the energy revolution come from? -- Mabuchi: what are their pasts, and how do they intertwine? This and more will slowly be answered as the two follow the trail of illegal coils.

## Art
The art quality starts off wonderful. It's clear that this series didn't have the highest budget of the season, but it does not bother me at all and I can appreciate the animation of fights and other *SCIENCE!* moments. For the most part, that is. As time goes on, the visual quality decreases significantly, especially in the last two episodes. So significantly that even I noticed it. Not a deal breaker on its own but still not good for the eyes.

The opening: I like the song. Features a small dance of one of the main characters, you may have heard the rumors. I found myself skipping the first part a lot, though I can imagine the need for repeating this dimension *W* stuff, maybe at some point someone will stop cringing at the core idea of "unlimited energy" if they just hear it more than enough.

## Characters and setting
The main characters are introduced well. Side characters are mostly interesting too. The world is colorful and appealing. Nice.

## Story
The story is alright, the mystery aspect is good and the individual little things that happen are definitely well done. It's only sad that the science fiction part does not really feel well thought out and it shows in later episodes. Unlike with, say, *Ergo Proxy* or *Steins;Gate*, the difficult parts don't feel interesting but just plain tangled up plot wherein even the writer got lost. Then again I may as well be stupid and it all makes great sense for you. I'll be taking a look at the manga to see if things are different or more clear there.

The situation here is the same as with the art, the last few episodes are just not on the same level as the rest, in a negative way. The end is *fine*, but it just isn't as fine as I expected it to be based on earlier episodes. I just took another look at episode one and it simply has that wow factor I can't spot in the last episode anymore.

## Conclusion
*Dimension W* is a nice anime to give a go if you like *Darker than Black* or similar series and you don't mind some fantasy science fiction. It starts off great but disappointingly falls of near the end. Don't let that bother you too much though, in my opinion it is still worth the watch for some. It's just not the awesome recommendation it could have been. Alas, perhaps it is in another dimension.
