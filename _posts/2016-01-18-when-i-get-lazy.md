summary: Read how I binned my half-baked, home-brew design and started using the Jekyll theme Pixyll.

Let me get straight to the point: I was lazy. I wanted to write a post and I didn't feel like hacking on my former Jekyll mess so I went to look for a prebuilt theme I could use. I just want to get some post ideas I've had for a while on virtual paper without finding another bug or unimplemented feature.

Luckily, there's a lot to choose from. [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/) lists plenty of good-looking style packages and even some full-blown content management systems. [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) seems to be in the middle-ground. I think it looks great, it has some nice prepared options to save hacking trouble, yet it doesn't feel like I've just bought a truck to move my chair around. And it looks nice without JavaScript.

The best part is that I didn't have to pay for it either. It's a free and open source project licensed under the MIT License. Good stuff indeed. A simple fork from the GitHub repository, a bit of careless edits here and there and we're good to go.

The downside of it all is that I had to either give up on my previous post links or put some effort in to see if I could maintain the same address for them. I'll let the reader guess what I chose to. The two old posts I've had here before may show up again in the future if I feel I want to publish them again. In the impossible case that you want a copy, don't hesitate to send me a message.

Now that's (hopefully) done for a while, I can finally get back to lazy post-writing. At least I won't be bored.
