title: True E-Sports are Free
summary: "Free software has several properties. Properties current e-sports are in desperate need of. A game everyone can play but no-one can own: the image of a true (e-)sport."

NOTE (2016-01-21): This was revised and republished because I think it's still relevant.

Modern gamers and many others have most certainly heard about the phenomenon called e-sports: people competing in virtual (computer) games like it's done with baseball and judo. They're games with certain rules one can practice and it's possible to compete with others. In general, one could say that e-sports are just another form of sports as we know them. However, there is one thing in which I think e-sports are seriously lacking compared to their less virtual counterparts: in every popular case, the rules (and right to play) are governed by certain entities in an absolute manner.

I'm a casual player of a rather popular electronic sports game called *League of Legends*. The company behind the game, Riot Games, is constantly pushing out new content and patches, changing the rules every few weeks. Games are hosted on *their* servers which are, together with the clients, updated automatically to the new version. Once an update comes out, the client has to be updated and the now old version of the game becomes unplayable. So what if someone doesn't like the changes? What if someone wants to host their own games on a different version? Tough luck.

*LoL* has been around for a while now, about five years to be more precise, and through all this time the game has been evolving constantly. If memory serves, I enjoyed the beginning of the third year most of all. The rules of the game were just great for my enjoyment. These days its rules are less appealing to me, and the upcoming year seems to be even worse.

I cannot change the rules. I cannot go back to a previous version of the game. If I want to keep playing League of Legends, I'll have to "stop whining" and continue playing. Or decide the game in its current state is no longer what I look for in an e-sport.

If League of Legends were free (as in freedom) software, I would be able to play the game how I enjoy it most: the way it was two years ago. Because it isn't, I and all the other players with me will have to cope with the newest version. If the UEFA football league decides to change the rules of the game in a way which I didn't like, I could host my own tournament with the rules I do agree with. With current e-sports, I cannot. How can a sport truly be a sport if its rules, the very essence of a sport, are monopolized by someone else? If I'm only allowed to practice on *their* virtual fields?

The answer, in my opinion, is quite simple: it can't. The only way for e-sports to become equal to a real sport is if they would be freed from their creator's shackles. True e-sports *have* to be free software, as in freedom. Only then any individual can decide on their own rules, only then will tournament leaders be able to decide for what kind of performance they will grant the title of honor.

Of course, making an e-sport game free software has its challenges. With the source code out in the open, creating clients with a bit more "handy features" than intended may become significantly easier (then again, lots of FOSS shooters seem to be doing great). But in exchange, the sport can grow as a whole. It will become truly timeless. Local tournaments will make sure no foul play is at hand when the stakes are high. Besides, what is a sport without sportsmanship?
